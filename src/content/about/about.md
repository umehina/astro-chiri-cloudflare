A static blog theme based on [Astro](https://astro.build), designed for clarity and focus.

With a deliberately minimal design, this layout ensures your content takes center stage. It's built for flexibility, offering customization options that honor its clean and elegant aesthetic.

Effortlessly share your thoughts in _a calm & dustless space._

This is a fork of the **[original project](https://github.com/the3ash/astro-chiri)** so that it can be deployed on Cloudflare Workers. Check posts for details and view source on [GitHub](https://github.com/umehina/astro-chiri-cloudflare).
